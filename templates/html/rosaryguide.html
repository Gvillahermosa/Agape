    <h1>Why do we Pray the Rosary</h1>
    <p>
        The purpose of the Rosary is to help keep in memory certain principal events in the history of our salvation.There are twenty mysteries reflected upon in the Rosary, and these are divided into the five <em>Joyful Mysteries(said on Monday and Saturday)</em>, the <em>five Luminous Mysteries (said on Thursday)</em>, the five Sorrowful Mysteries said on Tuesday and Friday), and the <em>five Glorious Mysteries (said on Wednesday and Sunday)</em>. As an excention the Joyful Mysteries may be said on Sundays during Advent and Christmas, while the Sorrowful Mysteries may be said on the Sundays of Lent.

 The question is sometimes asked, why, of all the incidents in our Lord's life, the Rosary only considers these particular twenty. The mysteries of the Rosary are based on the incidents in the life of Our Lord and His Mother that are celebrated in the Liturgy. There is a parallel between the main feasts honoring our Lord and his Mother in the liturgical year, and when twenty mysteries of the Rosary. Consequently, one who reccites the twenty mysteries of the Rosary in one day reflects on the whole liturgical cycle that the Church commemorates during the course of each year. That is why some of the Popes have referred to the Rosary as a compendium of the Gospel. One cannot change the mysteries of the Rosary without losing the indulgences that the Church grants for the recitation of the Rosary.

            <p>In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</p>

            <h3>The Apostles’ Creed:</h3>
            <p>I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried; he descended into hell; on the third day he rose again from the dead; he ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of the God the Father Almighty; from there he will come again to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen.</p>

            <h3>Hail Mary</h3>
            <p>Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen.</p>
            <h3>Glory Be</h3>
            <p>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.</p>

            <h2>Intentions</h2>
            <p>After the introductory prayers and before the mystery is announced the leader of the group may announce an intention for this particular decade. The intention may be a person by name, a group of persons, a prayer for peace and justice, or some other worthy cause, or a prayer for the deceased.</p>
            <p>Next, the leader will announce the mystery, for example, "The first sorrowful mystery is the agony in the garden." All twenty mysteries of the Rosary will follow the same three-step pattern, scripture, reflection and personal experience.</p>

Turn then, O most gracious Advocate, thine eyes of mercy toward us, and after this, our exile, show unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus. O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary! Pray for us, O Holy Mother of God, that we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ. Amen.</p>
